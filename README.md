# Tic Tac Toe Game

A simple Tic Tac Toe game built using **Godot**. This project is a graphical implementation of the classic two-player game, where users can compete against each other on a 3x3 grid.

## Features

- **Two-player Mode**: Play against a friend.
- **Graphical Interface**: Simple and interactive UI.
- **Winning Detection**: Highlights the winner or a draw.
- **Reset Option**: Quickly reset the board for a new game.

## Game Rules

- The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
- One player is X, and the other player is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
- The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) is the winner.
- When all 9 squares are full, the game ends in a draw if no player has 3 marks in a row.
